      Welcome to the dashboard! Right now you can see the <b>rules</b>, and the <b>global chat</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you declare an allegiance, you'll be able to see the <b>next mission</b> for your side, and your <b>faction
        chat</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the game starts, you'll also be able to see the <b>leaderboard</b>, <b>game stats</b>, <b>claim reward</b>,
      and <b>infect</b> modules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your next step into the apocalypse is to choose a side!
    </p>
    <p>
      Every player will have been both human and zombie by the end, but you get to choose which faction you start with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you join the Resistance, to resist the zombie menace?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or will you join the Horde, and hit the ground running as a zombie?
    </p>
    <p>
      ...or will you be the third, more sinister option?
    </p>
