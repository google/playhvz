  """A transaction is an atomic list of mutations that can be applied to the
  model. The mutation set is applied to the remote model only when the

  local model.

  Mutations in a transaction is stored in two parallel trees:
    - a data tree that keeps the data to mutate
    - a path tree that keeps track of which paths are updated

  The path tree is crawled to create a list of absolute paths that must be
  modified in a single patch. This list of paths is guaranteed to not have a
  path that is a parent of another path in the list.

  This is needed because patching paths where one is a parent of another can
  yield an inconsistent state and firebase doesn't support deep patches.

    put('a', 'b', {'c': {'d': foo'})
